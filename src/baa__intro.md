Save Check
: A last ditch attempt granted by the referee;
: 1d20 + (_skill_ or _level_ or nothing) ≥ some `TC`.

Skill

Skill Check
: A roll like 1d20 + some _skill_ ≥ some `TC`.

Target Class (TC)
: An ability `TC` is equal to 21 - the ability score;
: A "save" `TC` is the mean (rounded down) of two or three ability `TC`s;
: Skill checks are usually 1d20 + _skill_ ≥ `TC`;
: For example, the referee might demand 1d20 + _Exert_ ≥ `Strength TC` to break some tool.

Trait
: A small "exception" granted to the character to denote their side talent or specialization;
: A trait manifests at three level, _normal_, _very_, and _highly_.
