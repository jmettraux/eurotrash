# troll tactics

Or "OpFor Tactics", intelligent creatures are not just here to be decimated until the morale roll determines they flee or submit.

## Generalities

The goal of the fight remains always positive; the battle should only aim at victory, in other words, the destruction of the adversary. Solely parrying the enemy hits leads to defeat. Only detachments tasked with secondary missions could be forced to fight with aiming for victory.

Weakness will look for fighting procedures and success recipes and, under the weight of danger and responsibilities, will cling to them. The battle, however, like life itself, doesn't let itself trap in rigid frames, and no artificial tactic has ever borne in itself any warranty of success. The one who uses such methods loses his natural freedom and, with it, one of the most important of his victory conditions.

Learning the craft requires the training of some determined ways of fighting, but these are valid for the supposed "regular case". The particular case in this or that situation might require very different steps.

Only the one who masterfully owns those various techniques and who knows as well how to free himself from them with complete carelessness will draw victory on his side. The one who lets himself be governed by them is lost for good.


## Means of Fighting

The goal of the fight is victory, the destruction of the enemy. But this destruction from the material point of view has only a limited meaning. It rather means to destroy the will to resist of the enemy.

The means of fighting are ~~fighters~~, ~~weapons~~, and ~~fortifications~~.

### Fighters

The goal of the fight is thus the fighter, in other words the enemy fighters, whose complete knock out is generally neither possible nor even necessary. The battle is won where their will to resist is broken. All in all, fighting is a matter of morale or of psychology. Its targets are the souls of the enemy commander and of the fighters.

The decisive element is first and foremost the fighting spirit of the troop and its commanders. Numerical, material or technical superiority only come second, as does pure and simple skill.

The fighting spirit depends on the warlike disposition of a people, on the conviction of the fighter that he has the right on his side, on his military training, on his trust in his commanders and his own capabilities, and finally on his physical state.


### Weapons

The effectiveness of a weapon increases the morale of the fighter who serves it.

A poor weapon in the hands of a brave will always be more effective than the most sophisticated weapon in the hands of a coward.

There are no weapons without a counter-weapon or something that protects against it.

In a well organized unit, the various weapons are combined, like the voices in a choir.

When engaging his fighting means, the skilled commander accounts for the particular characteristics of each of them, in order to maximise their effectiveness. He must thus know the possibilities and efficiencies of each of the weapon he disposes of, as well as the constraints that weighs on them, and the conditions for their use.

The individual value of the fighter shines when using mêlée weapons. Such weapons serve to destroy the enemy during the decisive phase of the action.

Generally, mêlée weapons are weapons of the individual fighter and ranged weapons are weapons of the command.

Each ranged weapon has an optimal range. One has to take care to engage it at this range.

The moral effect of ranged weapons is a function of its material effect; if it lacks effectiveness, it will encourage the fighting will of the enemy.

The moral effect of ranged weapons is amplified if their action is concentrated in time and space, and if it is triggered by surprise.

Ranged weapons fire should aim at destroying the enemy, or at destroying materials and cover. If the means are lacking, in many cases, forcing the enemy to take cover or hindering his use of his weapons may be sufficient.

Purely harassing fires have poor value and are only efficient if they allow the creations of the delays required by the situation.

Triggered at a determined point in time, a fire should either facilitate a given action of ours, either crush the enemy during the decisive phase of the combat, either stop him in his advance. Exceptionally, only delaying the adversary will have to do.

Outside of the strictly delineated frame of the action, the fire should be triggered only if the enemy offers a favourable target, so that one may destroy it with a surprise fire.


### Fortifications

For the command, fortifications may be most useful fulcrums or, on the contrary, dangerous hindrances to its freedom of action.

The value of fortifications resides in the creation of permanent availabilities of weapons and ammunition, and of everything that is required by their garrisons to fight and subsist; it resides as well in all the preparations realized in advance to allow for an efficient use of their weapons, while protecting from enemy fire and from enemy assault from all directions. Fortifications may hold even in the case they are turned and assaulted from all sides.

Their downside lie in the rigidity of their zone of action, and also, when known by the adversary, they are almost unsuited for surprise actions.

Impregnable fortifications do not exist and will never exist.

The value of a fortification weighs no more and no less than the value of its defenders. The weapons, the thickness of the walls, the arrangement of its access, are nothing more than an unproductive capital. Only the will to resist of its commander and its garrison puts it to work and produces valuable interests.

Fortifications are used to ~~a)~~ gain time, in order to cover the preparation of troops behind them; ~~b)~~ act as a fulcrum or anchor point on the flanks of mobile troops; ~~c)~~ to channel the enemy attack.

Fortifications tasked with covering troop buildup, and thus left to themselves will be surrounded and will sooner or later fall. Such an use of a fortification should be an exception. It should only be decided if the intended goal justifies the loss of precious fighters and weapons.

Fortifications are at their most useful when used in close collaboration with mobile troops. They constitute thus, the most powerful pillars of a defensive front, or the anchor point of an offensive operation.

They allow stopping and blocking the enemy and give the opportunity to our troops to attack it on its flank or on its back.

Even if a chain of fortifications is broken, some of its pieces having given way, the movemement of the enemy would still be channelled in certain determined directions. The commander might take advantage of this situation to wait for the adversary behind the fortified line, and, with a surprise action, annihilate its fragmented attack columns, weakened by the fortification fire or hampered in its movements.

As passive barrages and fighting without liaison with the operations of mobile troops, fortifications have poor value and will fall shortly. Such an use doesn't warrant the inevitable loss of weapons, ammunition, and precious troops, nor the heavy cost required for their construction.

The one who hides in his fortifications, with the only aim of avoiding mobile warfare and melee combat is preparing his own defeat. Fortifications symbolize the tumb of the will to fight instead of constituting a useful victory factor.

The one who, to cover a fortification, engages mobile troops that would find a better use elsewhere and that doesn't intend to wage a decisive battle, he squanders precious fighting means.

_Passive means of defence_ reduce the effect of enemy weapons or hinder his movements.

The efficiency of enemy weapons is compromised by: ~~a)~~ splitting formations and spacing weapons; ~~b)~~ use of artificial means obstructing enemy sight; ~~c)~~ setting up artificial covers.

Splitting formations and spacing weapons disperse enemy fire and less considerably its material effect, but it makes commanding more difficult and hinders the overall action of our forces. It extends the time required for combat preparation. These means will thus be used if required by the excepted enemy fire.

Obstacles obstructing enemy sight make enemy fire impossible or at least make it imprecise. It can be obtained by using terrain and masks shielding the troop and its weapons from sighting from the ground, camouflage against sighting from above, and, in certain cases, by using artificial fog.

Such obstacles are the most important mean of passive defence at the disposition of the weak side. It cancels the superiority of the adversary's fighting means and allow for the use of surprise and ambush.

Artificial covers less the vulnerability of the fighters that man them. They must be used wherever a troop clings to the terrain, or if it finds itself temporarily forced to the defensive.
