# troll tactics

Or "OpFor Tactics", intelligent creatures are not just here to be decimated until the morale roll determines they flee or submit.

## Generalities

The goal of the fight remains always positive; the battle should only aim at victory, in other words, the destruction of the adversary. Solely parrying the enemy hits leads to defeat. Only detachments tasked with secondary missions could be forced to fight with aiming for victory.

Weakness will look for fighting procedures and success recipes and, under the weight of danger and responsibilities, will cling to them. The battle, however, like life itself, doesn't let itself trap in rigid frames, and no artificial tactic has ever borne in itself any warranty of success. The one who uses such methods loses his natural freedom and, with it, one of the most important of his victory conditions.

Learning the craft requires the training of some determined ways of fighting, but these are valid for the supposed "regular case". The particular case in this or that situation might require very different steps.

Only the one who masterfully owns those various techniques and who knows as well how to free himself from them with complete carelessness will draw victory on his side. The one who lets himself be governed by them is lost for good.

## Means of Fighting

The goal of the fight is victory, the destruction of the enemy. But this destruction from the material point of view has only a limited meaning. It rather means to destroy the will to resist fo the enemy.

The means of fighting are fighters, weapons, and fortifications.

### The Fighter

The goal of the fight is thus the fighter, in other words the enemy fighters, whose complete knock out is generally neither possible nor even necessary. The battle is won where their will to resist is broken. All in all, fighting is a matter of morale or of psychology. Its objective are the souls of the enemy commander and fighters.

The decisive element is first and foremost the fighting spirit of the troop and its commanders. Numerical, material or technical superiority only come second, as does pure and simple skill.

The fighting spirit depends on the warlike disposition of a people, on the conviction of the fighter that he has the right on his side, on his military training, on his trust in his commanders and his own capabilities, and finally on his physical state.

### The Weapons

The effectiveness of a weapon increases the morale of the fighter who serves it.

A poor weapon in the hands of a brave will always be more effective than the most sophisticated weapon in the hands of a coward.

There are no weapons without a counter-weapon or something that protects against it.

In a well organized unit, the various weapons are combined, like the voices in a choir.

When engaging his fighting means, the skilled commander accounts for the particular characteristics of each of them, in order to maximise their effectiveness. He must thus know the possibilities and efficiencies of each of the weapon he disposes of, as well as the constraints that weighs on them, and the conditions for their use.

The individual value of the fighter shines when using mêlée weapons. Such weapons serve to destroy the enemy during the decisive phase of the action.

Ranged weapons are weapons of the individual fighter or communal weapons.

Each ranged weapon has an optimal range. One has to take care to engage it at this range.

The moral effect of ranged weapons is a function of its material effect; if it lacks effectiveness, it will encourage the fighting will of the enemy.
