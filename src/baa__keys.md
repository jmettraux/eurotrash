ini
: Initiative. What is rolled for the creature to determine its rank in the initiative order.

atk
: Attack. Attack bonus followed by attack possibilities and respective damage.
: Pushed to the right in grey is the THAC0, should you need it.
: In small and grey for each damage dice, the average damage value.

sav
: Save check pattern. Three choices here `PHY TC` (physical), `EVA TC` (evasion), and `MEN TC` (mental).
: Other `DC`s are OK, but they have to be computed.

mv

: In grey, the B/X encounter movement rate. Multiply by 3 to get the base movement rate.

ml
: Morale. If the 2d6 roll is successful, the creature "group" stays in the fight. If it fails, the group will flee or try to parlay.

DC
: Defend Classes. For the six abilities `STR`, `CON`, `DEX`, `INT`, `WIS`, and `CHA`, the DC is simply the score. The second row has _derived_ DCs, like `BOD` DC (body), and `EVA` DC (evasion).

skl
: Skills. Mostly _Hunt_, _Scout_, _Spy_, _Swim_, skills that can easily be mapped to monsters and animals.
