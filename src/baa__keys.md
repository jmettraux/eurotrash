HD
: Hit dice, with average HP count (4.5 HP per HD rounded down).

AC
: Armor Class.

ini
: Initiative. What is rolled for the creature to determine its rank in the initiative order.

atk
: Attack. Attack bonus followed by attack possibilities and respective damage.

sav
: Save check pattern. Three choices here `PHY` TC (physical), `EVA` TC (evasion), and `MEN` TC (mental).
: Other `DC`s are OK, but they have to be computed.

mv
: Movement. Max Distance that can be covered with 1 Move Action in 1 combat round (6 seconds).

ml
: Morale. If the 2d6 roll is successful, the creature "group" stays in the fight. If it fails, the group will flee or try to parlay.

siz
: Size. Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The area / base covered is also described, for example, 1sq Ã— 1sq.

DC
: Defend Classes. For the six abilities `STR`, `CON`, `DEX`, `INT`, `WIS`, and `CHA`, the DC is simply the score. The second row has _derived_ DCs, like `BOD` DC (body), and `EVA` DC (evasion).

skl
: Skills. Mostly _Hunt_, _Scout_, _Spy_, _Swim_, skills that can easily be mapped to monsters and animals.
